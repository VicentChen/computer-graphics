# Learn OpenGL
 - Website: [LearnOpenGL][1] is a good website for learning OpenGL and computer graphics.
 - This project contains all the code of LearnOpenGL(Currently only covers to "[Shadows][2]") and will not update for a long time, since the advancing CG needs much more theory and math tools. This website cannot provide detailedly explanation or introduction to advancing CG, and the quality of code behind "Advanced OpenGL" becomes bad.
